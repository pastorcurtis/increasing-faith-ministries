      "content": "**From the Desk of Pastor Curtis**\n\n**February 2026: Kingdom Love**\n\nAs we embark on this new month, I want to focus our attention on the radical, sacrificial love of King Jesus. You see, the Kingdom of God is not just a place where love resides; it is a dynamic, living force that transforms and redefines the way we think, live, and love.\n\nIn John 15:13, Jesus says, \"Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.\" This is not just a sentimental phrase; it's a declaration of the very nature of the Kingdom. King Jesus laid down His life for us, demonstrating the ultimate expression of love. And if we are to be His followers, we must emulate this kind of love in our own lives.\n\nBut what does this look like in practical terms? It means laying down our own desires, our own comfort, and our own interests for the sake of others. It means serving, sacrificing, and giving ourselves away for the benefit of those around us. As Jesus said in Matthew 20:28, \"Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.\" This is the kind of love that breaks down barriers, builds bridges, and brings people into the Kingdom.\n\nAs we seek to live out this radical, sacrificial love in our daily lives, I want to encourage you to be intentional about serving others. Look for opportunities to lay down your life for those around you. Volunteer, give, serve, and love without expecting anything in return. This is the essence of Kingdom living, and it is the key to experiencing the fullness of God's love in our lives.\n\nSo, I charge you to be a vessel of Kingdom love this month. Lay down your life for others, just as King Jesus laid down His life for us. Together, let's bring the love of the Kingdom to our families, our communities, and our world.\n\n**Pastor Curtis**"

      "content": "### South Korean Pastor's Release Sparks Hope for Persecuted Christians\nPastor Hyun-Bo Son, a prominent Christian leader in South Korea, was released from prison on February 5, 2026, after being arrested in September 2025 for alleged electioneering and interference with the election process. His release has sparked hope among persecuted Christians worldwide, who face increasing scrutiny and harassment for their faith. Despite the challenges, Pastor Son's resilience and commitment to Christ stand as a testament to the faith and courage that defines the global Church.\n\n**Kingdom Perspective:** As Jesus' lordship advances in every sphere, even in the face of adversity, His followers demonstrate unwavering devotion, inspiring hope and resilience in the midst of persecution.\n\n### The Church Finds Unity in Shared Faith\nIn a time of deep division, Christianity Today reports that many churches are seeking a more unified expression of faith. A shift towards community and shared worship is emerging, as believers increasingly recognize that Jesus' lordship is not limited to individual salvation but extends to all aspects of life. This movement towards unity is a significant step towards forming a more robust and influential expression of the Kingdom.\n\n**Kingdom Perspective:** As the Church unites around Jesus' lordship, it becomes a more powerful and attractive embodiment of the Kingdom, shining a light of hope and unity in a world torn apart by division.\n\n### Fasting and Prayer Fuel Kingdom Movements\nRecent reports highlight the growing significance of fasting and prayer in fueling Kingdom movements worldwide. The Gospel Coalition notes that deepening one's relationship with God through prayer is a critical aspect of this practice. As Christians fast and pray, they become more attuned to Jesus' lordship and empowered to advance the Kingdom in every sphere of society. This renewed focus on prayer is a testament to the power and necessity of the Holy Spirit in Kingdom transformation.\n\n**Kingdom Perspective:** As the Church fasts and prays, it becomes more aligned with Jesus' lordship, unlocking the power of the Holy Spirit to advance the Kingdom in every sphere of society, transforming individuals, communities, and cultures."

      "content": "**Kingdom Living: Embodying Kingdom Love in Every Sphere**\n\nThis month, we're exploring the transformative power of Kingdom love. As Jesus' followers, we're called to embody His love in every aspect of our lives, impacting the world around us. In 1 Corinthians 16:14, Paul exhorts us to \"do everything in love.\" Let's put this into practice in various spheres of our lives.\n\n**At Home: Create a Culture of Love**\n\nIn the midst of busy schedules and daily routines, it's easy to overlook the importance of love in our families. This month, set aside dedicated time to:\n\n1. **Have a family love jar**: Write down acts of kindness, gratitude, and love on slips of paper and put them in a jar. Read them aloud during dinner or family gatherings to remind each other of the love you share.\n2. **Schedule love dates**: Regularly plan intentional time with your spouse or loved ones, doing activities that bring joy and connection.\n3. **Show physical affection**: Hold hands, give hugs, and offer physical touch to express love and affection.\n\n**At Work: Demonstrate Kingdom Love in the Marketplace**\n\nIn the workplace, we have opportunities to demonstrate Kingdom love to our colleagues, customers, and clients. This month:\n\n1. **Listen actively**: Give your full attention to others, asking questions and seeking to understand their perspectives.\n2. **Offer help without expectation**: Volunteer to assist a colleague or support a client in need, without expecting recognition or reward.\n3. **Speak words of encouragement**: Share words of affirmation and appreciation with your team, building each other up and celebrating successes.\n\n**In Our Communities: Serve with Kingdom Love**\n\nAs we engage with our communities, let's embody Kingdom love by serving others selflessly. This month:\n\n1. **Volunteer your time**: Identify a local organization or cause that aligns with your values and give your time to serve.\n2. **Offer kindness to strangers**: Smile, hold the door, or offer a kind word to someone you don't know.\n3. **Pray for your neighbors**: Take time to pray for the people living around you, asking God to shower them with His love and presence.\n\nAs we embody Kingdom love in every sphere, may we become beacons of hope and transformation in our world."

      "title": "Scripture of the Month",
      "content": "**Scripture of the Month: Kingdom Love**\n\n\n**Matthew 25:31-46 (NIV)**\n\n\"When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne. All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.\n\n\"Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you took me in, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.'\n\n\"Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? When did we see you a stranger and take you in, or naked and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?'\n\n\"And the King will reply, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.' Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, I was a stranger and you did not take me in, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.\"\n\n\n\n**Commentary**\n\nIn this pivotal passage, Jesus reveals the connection between His Kingdom and the demonstration of love and compassion to those around us. The King, Jesus Christ, sits in judgment, separating the nations and evaluating the treatment of the vulnerable by His followers. Those who have shown kindness, hospitality, and care for the \"least of these\" are welcomed into the Kingdom, having been blessed by the Father. Conversely, those who have neglected the needs of others will be condemned.\n\nThis passage highlights the Kingdom dimension of love: it's not just a feeling or a sentimental expression, but a demonstration of allegiance to the King. By serving others, we serve Jesus Himself. As we seek to embody Kingdom love in our daily lives, we must ask ourselves: \"Who are the 'least of these' in my life, and how can I demonstrate Jesus' love to them?\"\n\n**Meditation:** Who are the \"least of these\" in your life, and how can you show Jesus' love to them today?"
