      "Increasing Faith Ministries (IFM) is a global, Kingdom-centered teaching ministry founded on the conviction that faith increases when believers understand and live according to Kingdom truth. Led by Pastors Curtis Stephens Jr. and Tammy Stephens, IFM has faithfully served for over 28 years, teaching the Word of God with clarity, authority, and compassion.",
      "At its core, IFM exists to restore Kingdom understanding—moving believers beyond religious tradition into a lifestyle shaped by God's government, order, and intent. Through sound teaching, pastoral care, and prophetic insight, the ministry develops disciplined Kingdom citizens who are equipped to walk out their faith in real life, with wisdom, integrity, and purpose.",
      "Grounded in Jesus' command to \"seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness\" (Matthew 6:33), IFM emphasizes spiritual maturity, renewed identity, and transformed living. The ministry teaches that in Christ, believers are not only forgiven—but made new (2 Corinthians 5:17), empowered to represent Heaven in the earth.",
      "Increasing Faith Ministries serves a global community of believers who desire more than inspiration—those who are committed to growth, obedience, and Kingdom impact that touches families, communities, and nations."
